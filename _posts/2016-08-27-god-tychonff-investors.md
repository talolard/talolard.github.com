###  Five minutes on Topology

Of all the courses I took in college, topology intrigued me the most and pulled my imagination in new directions across hundreds of dimensions. 
The classic definition of topology is the study of continuous functions, but such a dry formulation doesn't do the field justice. Topology is the study of how we look at things, that are made of small pieces, as larger, richer entities. 

![The cantor Cube][cantorcube] **The cantor cube is a topological object, made by repeatedly slicing away the middle third of the cube**


The human body is a set of atoms. At one resolution I can amass those sets and talk about the cells in my body, at another, I can talk about my arms, legs, liver and kidney. At yet another resolution, I can speak about my physical body and my consciousness. At each of these resolutions, I can separate between the different parts, say my arm and kidney, without ever thinking of the constituent atoms. This may sound like a trivial truism but imagine that you could only think about yourself at the resolution of atoms; how would you tell if you need a haircut or a vacation without being able to tell your hair apart from your soul?

In Topology, we are given a set - the atoms in my body, and define a topology on that set. To make a topology, we define a bunch of subsets that abide by the rules of Topology. The rules of topology are a little too dry for this post, so lets keep going with the human body example. We could roughly split the atoms in my body according to the function they serve. Some of them help clean my blood, some break down food, others absorb nutrients, some let me walk. In this way, we can go from my body as a collection of atoms, into  my liver, stomach, intestines and legs. 

We can have multiple topologies on the same set, for example instead of looking at my body at the resolution of organs, we could look at it in terms of systems, the muscular system, digestive system, skeletal system and so on. Lets call that the Systems Topology and the topology at the resolution of my organs the Organs topology. Please notice the Systems Topology is a coarser version of the Organs Topology and that the Organs Topology is a finer version of the Systems Topology. That is to say that the Organs topology captures all of the information in the Systems Topology, but in more detail. Topology admits this notion of finer and coarser topologies on the same set, in much the same way that YouTube admits finer and coarser resolutions on their videos. 

###  Compactness

Being compact is a valuable trait in Mathematics. The set of all of the numbers between 0 and 1 [0,1], is compact -its bound above by 1 and below by 0 and the bounds are part of the set. But all of the numbers in general are not compact, they are bound by infinity but infinity is not a number. Put simply, their is no largest or smallest number. 

Topology allows us to extend the notion of compactness from just the numbers to any collection of things that we bother to define a topology on. If you've ever enjoyed some electronic music made on a digital synthesizer you may have wondered how can some code on a digital machine produce the sound of a drum, a piano or some sound you could never have imagined. Sounds are waves - or in math speak sounds are continuous periodic functions. Some crazy people defined a topology on continuous functions, expanded the notion of compactness from numbers to these functions and eventually showed that we can approximate any of these functions, to any degree of precision with just really basic mathematical operations. This theorem is called the [Stone–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem) , and it relies extensively on the notion of compactness.

The beauty of it is that once that was done, we could build synthesizers to our hearts delight. Here is an example of the Japanese artist Riyoji Ikeda leveraging the Stone–Weierstrass theorem to generate sound and light via synthesizers.

###  Definitions
[whotoldyou]: /assets/img/posts/definitions/whotoldyou.jpg
I opened this post with the passage from the bible where God asks Adam, "Who told you that you were naked?" Isn't that a strange question, to me it is glaringly obvious when I am naked and when I am not - nobody needs to tell me that. But the writer of the bible raises a subtle a point when God asks Adam "Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?". Labels and definitions, even the most obvious ones need to come from somewhere.

![Who told you?][whotoldyou]

So far my little expose about topology hasn't shown you much aside from labels and definitions and one can say that the majority of the mathematical experience is defining things and discovering what those definitions imply.
Unfortunately, we don't live in the garden of Eden and the tree of knowledge has been cut down, so we don't always know if our definitions are the best ones.

What does it even mean for a definition to be good, not to mention the best? A good definition or label, is one that lets us mentally manipulate the thing we are working with easily. It allows the defined or labeled to reveal its secrets, to be accessible. A good definition, of a topology, of a topological concept or maybe even of a personal goal, allows us to move forward. 

I wanted to write this because I like topology, but also because I think about the definitions I apply to my life. I remember the wonder in my Professors eyes when he told taught us a particular theorem that relied on a very unintuitive definition. The fact that the theorem worked, he said, was the proof that the definition was good, and that it was a good idea to replace previous definitions with it. I think that holds true in general, some of the definitions we apply in life don't work, and we are free to change them.

Great you made it! You'll get my next letter as soon as it comes out. 
In the mean time, here's a favourite tidbit of mine from the great mathametician [Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s)
    
    SF means Supreme Fascist … 
    As a joke I said, "What is the purpose of Life?" 
    "Proof and conjecture, and keep the SF's score low."
    Now, the game with the SF is defined as follows:
    If you do something bad the SF gets at least two points.
    If you don't do something good which you could have done,
     the SF gets at least one point.
    And if nothing — if you are okay, then no one gets any point.
    And the aim is to keep the SF's score low.
